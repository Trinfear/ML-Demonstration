## **Machine Learning Demonstrations**
A set of Scripts demonstrating use cases and from-scratch examples of several common algorithms in machine learning and datascience.
### Contents
##### K Nearest Neighbors
A supervised sorting algorithm, useful for finding which group of an already extant set of groups a new data point falls into
##### K Means
A supervised grouping and clustering algorithm, useful in finding patterns in data and organizing data, if one already knows
the rough number of groups they hope to find
##### Linear Regression
A supervised modeling algorithm, useful for trying to find the linear relationship between one or more features and a label
##### Mean Shift
An unsupervised version of K Means which does not require previous knowledge on the number of groups. Useful for simple processing on
new and unexplored data
##### Naive Bayes
A supervised implementation of Bayes Theorom with the 'naive' assumption that all features are independant. Useful for predicting a label
based upon the presence or lack of different features, such as sentiment analysis in text.
