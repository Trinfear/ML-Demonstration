## **Machine Learning Demonstrations**
A set of Scripts demonstrating use cases and from-scratch examples of several common algorithms in machine learning and datascience.
##### Use vs From Scratch
the uses cases are meant to demonstrate knowledge of existing algorithms and the situations and types of data on which the algorithms
are used.  The from scratch examples are meant to demonstrate a strong understanding of the inner workings of the algorithms, and
how they may work when being used as part of a broader project.
### Contents
##### Decision Tree
A supervised sorting algorithm, decision trees are easy to use and understand, and at times require less data preperation. They work
well when there is data that is nonlinearly related.  It can also be used on strings without requiring any form of embedding.
##### Simple Neural Networks
A group of supervised learning algorithms, useful for a variety of tasks depending on the specific type of network used.  Can technically be used to approach most problems but are most useful when provided with a larger amount of data, and other algorithms are incapable of returning accurate results, or when a very high degree of precision is required.
##### K Nearest Neighbors
A supervised sorting algorithm, useful for finding which group of an already extant set of groups a new data point falls into
##### K Means
A supervised grouping and clustering algorithm, useful in finding patterns in data and organizing data, if one already knows
the rough number of groups they hope to find
##### Linear Regression
A supervised modeling algorithm, useful for trying to find the linear relationship between one or more features and a label
##### Mean Shift
An unsupervised version of K Means which does not require previous knowledge on the number of groups. Useful for simple processing on
new and unexplored data
##### Naive Bayes
A supervised implementation of Bayes Theorom with the 'naive' assumption that all features are independant. Useful for predicting a label
based upon the presence or lack of different features, such as sentiment analysis in text.
